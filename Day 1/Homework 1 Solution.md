# Solution

A decentralized version of a game like Monopoly would be an interesting concept to explore. Such a version of the game would involve multiple nodes, where each node represents a player, and the game state is distributed across all nodes in a peer-to-peer fashion.

To prevent cheating, the game would need to implement some form of consensus mechanism, such as a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake algorithm, to ensure that all players are playing by the rules. This would require each node to perform a certain amount of work or stake a certain amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions and ensure that the game state is accurate.

Ensuring agreement about the state of the system and communication problems can be addressed by implementing a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain, to record all game transactions. This would enable all nodes to view the same state of the game and keep track of any updates made to the game board.

To decide who should take the next turn, a random number generator could be implemented to select the next player in line. Alternatively, a voting system could be used, where each player gets to vote on the next player to take their turn.

Allowing the correct people to join the game can be achieved through a variety of methods, such as requiring players to register with their public keys, and allowing only those players with the appropriate keys to access the game. Additionally, players could be required to stake a certain amount of cryptocurrency to participate in the game, which would discourage malicious actors from joining the game.

Overall, a decentralized version of Monopoly could offer a more transparent and fair gameplay experience, while also leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology to prevent cheating and ensure agreement about the state of the game. 

## More on the Turn System

In a decentralized version of Monopoly, the turn system would need to be carefully designed to ensure that all players have an equal opportunity to play and that the game proceeds smoothly.

One possible approach to turn-taking is to use a random number generator to select the player who goes first at the beginning of the game. After that, each turn could be triggered by a smart contract that is executed when the current player completes their turn. The smart contract would randomly select the next player in the queue to take their turn, based on some predefined criteria, such as the order in which players joined the game.

Alternatively, a voting system could be used to decide which player takes the next turn. In this scenario, each player would get to vote on the next player to take their turn, and the player with the most votes would go next. This approach would require more coordination and communication between players, but it could also lead to a more democratic and collaborative gameplay experience.

Another important consideration in the turn system is how to handle timeouts or players who disconnect from the game unexpectedly. To address this issue, a timeout mechanism could be implemented that automatically ends the turn of a player who does not complete their turn within a certain time frame. Alternatively, players could be given a limited amount of time to complete their turn, and if they exceed this time limit, their turn would be automatically skipped.
