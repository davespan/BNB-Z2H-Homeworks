## Solution 

Using hardhat:
1. Create a project for your Badger coin.
2. Write unit tests for your Badger coin contract.

The tests should show that:
1. The total supply is initially 1000000.
2. That the number of decimals is 18.
3. The balanceOf function returns the correct result.
4. The transfer function works correctly.
5. Test that an error is produced if a transfer is created with an insufficient balance.

For help with the syntax for unit tests see
