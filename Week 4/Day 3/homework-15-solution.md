## Solution

Using the Badger Coin you created in previous homeworks:
1. Make sure that the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions are implemented.
>**Answer**: The BadgerCoin contract inherits those functions from the OpenZeppelin [ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.8.2/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) contract.
2. Add pausable functionality; you can use the OpenZeppelin Pausable contract.
3. Write unit tests to test the above functionality.
4. Deploy you new contract onto the test network.
